# nanoweb


nanoweb is a minimal library for building server-centric multi page web applications that behave like SPAs.

- **HTML-over-the-wire**: Merges HTML responses instead of replacing the complete page.
- **Based on standards**: Doesn't reinvent the wheel. It uses [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).
- **Minimal**: Currently 560 LOC and the API consists of **only 5 functions**.
- **Component-based**: Build encapsulated components, then compose them to make complex UIs.

nanoweb's ideas can be freely combined with other server-centric frameworks while avoiding a technology lock-in, which makes it a perfect fit for [micro-frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html).
