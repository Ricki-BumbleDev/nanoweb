Some IDEs might not support syntax highlighting or auto-completion inside `html` template tags. You can rely on plugins for [lit-html](http://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) in those cases. Its `html` template tag syntax is a strict superset of `nanoweb/template`'s `html` function. You can find a curated list of plugins [here](https://github.com/web-padawan/awesome-lit-html#ide-plugins).
